# ExecuTorch build & on-device inference — setup log and troubleshooting

This documents how the SLM (Phi-3 mini) path was wired up to run real
on-device ExecuTorch inference instead of `SlmInferenceEngine`'s mock
fallback, and every build error hit along the way. Use it as a reference
the next time a build breaks in this area.

## One-time environment setup

1. **Python venv for the ExecuTorch build** (kept separate from system
   Python so it doesn't fight with other projects' torch/transformers
   versions):
   ```bash
   /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.11 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

2. **Clone ExecuTorch from source** (gitignored — it's a build dependency,
   not vendored source):
   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 --branch main https://github.com/pytorch/executorch.git
   cd executorch
   git submodule sync
   git submodule update --init --recursive --depth 1
   ```

3. **Install ExecuTorch's Python build deps** (pulls a matching
   torch/torchao/transformers set into the venv):
   ```bash
   source ../.venv/bin/activate
   ./install_executorch.sh
   ```

4. **Build the native library for arm64-v8a**:
   ```bash
   source ../.venv/bin/activate
   export ANDROID_NDK=/Users/akhil/Library/Android/sdk/ndk/25.1.8937393
   export PYTHON_EXECUTABLE=python3
   cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=cmake-out-android-arm64-v8a \
     -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="$ANDROID_NDK/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake" \
     -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=python3 --preset android-arm64-v8a \
     -DANDROID_PLATFORM=android-26 -B cmake-out-android-arm64-v8a
   cmake --build cmake-out-android-arm64-v8a -j 7 --target install --config Release
   ```
   This produces `executorch/cmake-out-android-arm64-v8a/`, containing the
   exported CMake package (`lib/cmake/ExecuTorch/executorch-config.cmake`)
   that `app/CMakeLists.txt` consumes — see below. Do **not** try to use
   `scripts/build_android_library.sh` directly under this tool's shell: its
   `uname`/`[ == ]` check breaks under zsh (see Issue 2).

## How the app consumes the build

`app/CMakeLists.txt` does **not** look for a prebuilt `libexecutorch.so`.
It consumes ExecuTorch's own exported CMake package via `find_package
(executorch CONFIG)`, pointed at the install tree above. This was a
deliberate choice over hand-picking raw `.a` link order: the exported
targets (`extension_module_static`, `extension_tensor`,
`optimized_native_cpu_ops_lib`, `quantized_ops_lib`, `custom_ops`,
`xnnpack_backend`, `extension_llm_runner`) carry their own correct
transitive dependency graph.

`cpp/executorch_jni.cpp` implements the JNI bridge by hand (not via
ExecuTorch's official Android AAR/Java API) using:
- `executorch::extension::module::Module` for model load/forward
- `executorch::extension::from_blob` for tensor construction
- `executorch::extension::llm::load_tokenizer()` for the tokenizer (auto-
  detects HF JSON / TikToken / SentencePiece / BPE format)

## Known issues and fixes (in the order they were hit)

### 1. `AttributeError: module 'torch' has no attribute 'int1'`
Installed `torchao` was newer than installed `torch` (torchao referenced
sub-byte dtypes that don't exist in the older torch). Fix: reinstall the
versions pinned in `requirements.txt` (`torchao==0.5.0`,
`transformers==4.44.2`) for the **system** Python env used by the export
scripts. The dedicated `.venv` for the ExecuTorch *build* avoids this
entirely by installing its own consistent torch/torchao pair via
`install_executorch.sh`.

### 2. `build_android_library.sh` dies silently after CMake configure
`set -ex` + `if [ "$(uname)" == "Darwin" ]` breaks when the script is
*sourced* into zsh (zsh's `[ ]` doesn't support `==`). The pipe
(`... | tail -100`) also masks the real exit code, since the pipeline's
exit status becomes `tail`'s. Fix: run `cmake --build ... --target
install` directly instead of relying on the script's job-count logic.

### 3. `cmake_install.cmake: file INSTALL cannot set modification time ... No such file or directory`
Transient filesystem hiccup during a parallel (`-j N`) install copying
many header files at once. Fix: retry with `-j 1`.

### 4. `app/CMakeLists.txt`: `find_package(executorch)` silently falls back to stub mode
`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`-based discovery doesn't reliably match a package
directory named `ExecuTorch` (mixed case) when the package name passed to
`find_package` is lowercase `executorch`. Fix: set `executorch_DIR`
directly to the exact `lib/cmake/ExecuTorch` directory instead of relying
on prefix-path globbing.

### 5. `CMake 3.24 or higher is required. You are running version 3.22.1`
The Android-SDK-bundled CMake (pinned via `version = "3.22.1"` in
`app/build.gradle.kts`) is older than what ExecuTorch's exported config
requires. `local.properties`'s `cmake.dir` is **not** a real AGP property
(common misconception) — it has no effect. Fix: manufacture an SDK-style
CMake package directory pointing at a newer system CMake, and bump the
declared version to match:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/Library/Android/sdk/cmake/3.31.0/bin
ln -sf /opt/homebrew/Cellar/cmake/4.3.1/bin/cmake   ~/Library/Android/sdk/cmake/3.31.0/bin/cmake
ln -sf /opt/homebrew/Cellar/cmake/4.3.1/bin/ctest   ~/Library/Android/sdk/cmake/3.31.0/bin/ctest
ln -sf /opt/homebrew/Cellar/cmake/4.3.1/bin/cpack   ~/Library/Android/sdk/cmake/3.31.0/bin/cpack
ln -sf /opt/homebrew/Cellar/cmake/4.3.1/bin/ccmake  ~/Library/Android/sdk/cmake/3.31.0/bin/ccmake
ln -sf <path-to-ninja>                              ~/Library/Android/sdk/cmake/3.31.0/bin/ninja
```
and set `version = "3.31.0"` in `app/build.gradle.kts`'s
`externalNativeBuild.cmake` block.

### 6. `The link interface of target "cpuinfo" contains: absl::log ... but the target was not found`
`find_dependency(absl REQUIRED)` inside ExecuTorch's `tokenizers-config.cmake`
resolved to some *other*, mismatched `absl`/`re2` install elsewhere on the
system search path instead of the one cross-compiled for Android in our
tree. Fix: pin the transitive package dirs explicitly in
`app/CMakeLists.txt` before `find_package(executorch CONFIG)`:
```cmake
set(absl_DIR "${_et_cmake_out}/lib/cmake/absl")
set(re2_DIR "${_et_cmake_out}/lib/cmake/re2")
set(tokenizers_DIR "${_et_cmake_out}/lib/cmake/tokenizers")
set(executorch_DIR "${_et_cmake_out}/lib/cmake/ExecuTorch")
```

### 7. `non-constant-expression cannot be narrowed from type 'int64_t' to 'int'`
`executorch::aten::SizesType` is a 32-bit int in this (lean/portable)
build, not `int64_t`. Any `std::vector<int64_t>` passed to `from_blob()`'s
sizes parameter needs to be a `std::vector<SizesType>` instead. Fixed in
both `nativeForward` and `nativeForwardFloat` in `cpp/executorch_jni.cpp`.

### 8. Gradle `:app:compressDebugAssets` → `OutOfMemoryError: Required array size too large`
AGP's asset-compression step reads the whole asset into a Java array
before deflating it, which has a hard ~2GB ceiling. The `medi_phi_int4.pte`
(2.49GB) blew past it — and `androidResources { noCompress += listOf
("pte") }` does **not** fix this, because the failure happens before the
compression-vs-store decision is even made; it's reading the file into
memory unconditionally. Fix: don't put multi-GB model weights through
Android's asset pipeline at all. Moved the `.pte` to `local_models/` at
the repo root (gitignored) and `adb push` it directly to
`context.getExternalFilesDir("models")` at runtime; `tokenizer.model`
(488KB) stays a normal bundled asset.
`ExecuTorchRunner.kt`'s `resolveModelPath()` checks the external files dir
first, falling back to the bundled asset.

### 9. App stays in mock mode even with a valid model + tokenizer on device
Not a build error — a wiring bug. `AssistantViewModel.initialise()` called
`rag.initialize()` (which loads the embedding model) but never called
`slm.load()` / `llm.load()`. `InferenceTool.route()` goes straight to
`slm.runInference()` without loading first, so `ExecuTorchRunner.isReady`
stayed permanently `false` regardless of what was on disk. Fix: added
```kotlin
slm.load()
llm.load()
```
right after `rag.initialize()` in `AssistantViewModel.kt`.

### 10. `adb install` → `INSTALL_FAILED_USER_RESTRICTED: Install canceled by user`
Android showed an on-device install-confirmation dialog that timed out
unapproved. Fix: just retry `adb install -r ...` and tap "Install" on the
phone when prompted.

### 11. `forward() failed: error=16` (`Error::NotSupported`) after ~18s of real compute
Not a build/wiring issue — a property of the specific `.pte` file. Added
diagnostic logging to `cpp/executorch_jni.cpp`'s `nativeLoad` (dumps
`Module::method_meta("forward")`'s expected input count/shape/dtype) and to
`nativeForward` (logs the numeric `Error` code on failure). This revealed
`forward()` expects a **static** `[1, 6]` int64 input — the model was
exported with a fixed 6-token context (most likely a quick smoke-test
export without `dynamic_shapes`), so any real prompt (which tokenizes to
far more than 6 tokens) fails — most likely hitting a position-dependent
constant (e.g. a rotary-embedding cache) sized for only 6 positions, given
that failure takes ~18s of real computation rather than failing instantly
on a shape check. **Fix is to re-export the model** with
`torch.export.Dim("seq_len", min=1, max=max_seq_len)` actually succeeding
(see `scripts/export_phi3.py`'s `_try_export`) — this has not been done
yet.

## Useful diagnostic commands

```bash
# Device connectivity (wireless ADB drops frequently — prefer USB if flaky)
adb devices -l

# Confirm the pushed model size matches the source file exactly
adb shell stat -c '%s' /sdcard/Android/data/com.edgemind.debug/files/models/medi_phi_int4.pte

# Watch model/tokenizer load + inference in real time
adb logcat -s "ExecuTorchJNI:*" "ExecuTorchRunner:*" "Tokenizer:*" "InferenceTool:*" "AssistantViewModel:*"

# Full install -> relaunch -> log cycle after a rebuild
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb shell am force-stop com.edgemind.debug
adb shell monkey -p com.edgemind.debug -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER 1
```

A clean successful load looks like:
```
ExecuTorchJNI: Loading model: .../medi_phi_int4.pte
ExecuTorchJNI: Model loaded, handle=1
ExecuTorchJNI: forward() expects 1 input(s)
ExecuTorchJNI:   input[0]: shape=[1,6,] dtype=4
ExecuTorchJNI: Loading tokenizer: .../tokenizer.model
ExecuTorch: Loaded Sentencepiece tokenizer
ExecuTorchJNI: Tokenizer loaded, handle=1
```
(The `shape=[1,6,]` here is exactly the Issue 11 limitation — a future
re-export should show a dynamic/larger bound instead.)
